# Connect Four

## Ant -p / build.xml

* ant -p / build.xml
targets javadoc, test, and jar are not incorporated when you do ant -p. 
ant -p does show run, compile, and clean with default target being compile

## Issues (that I will do)

* 100 points: improve readme to be the same as the example readme file
* PARTLY DONE: 100 points: Make a new screen for the rules section (should have a main menu button to go back)
* 100 points: Finish adding javadoc to the classes


## Bugs

* When forwarding graphics through X11, in single player mode after the user's 1st click it will place the red tile but will not place the AI yellow tile, and will print "didn't work". After the 2nd click however it will create the AI's move and draw it and will not register it as a user click.  This process repeats for every move. I'm not sure if this is a problem because of the forwarding through X11 or if it is an actual bug in the code. My guess is that it is because of X11 because I haven't knowingly written anything that would mess with the AI's moves.
  * Tested on csil and it works perfectly. The bug is a result of the X11 forwarding.
 

## Proposal: additional features (issues)

* DONE: Add blue background behind the circles for contrast. Change winning circles to green.
* Sign on the board saying whose turn it is. Do this after you check the "didn't work"/forwarding bug.
* Select color for circles. 
* Enter player names, which then says whose turn it is on the board.
* DONE: Add main menu button to the single player difficulty screen.
* Undo button for turns during the game.
  * Can't undo when 0 moves have been done.
  * Need to keep track of whose turn it is.
  * Need to keep track of the order of all moves. 
    * This can be done just by keeping a vector of all the moves. There can be 42  (0-41) possible moves. Make sure to redraw the circle as all white and to set the spot in the gamegrid as available. And then delete the move from the movesList vector.
    * Keep a move number counter. Increment it with each move, decrement 1 or 2 for each undo depending on the game mode.
    * Multiplayer: only undo one move at a time. Alternating between whose turn it is based on what point the undo stops at.
    * Singleplayer: undo both the computer's move and then the user's move. It always is the users turn. 
  * What can be tricky is if you could undo after the game has ended. (Would need to change graphics a lot)
* Timer
* Work on AI difficulty
* Have a "games won" counter for when they press restart and continue playing more games
